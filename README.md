# Neuroimaging-Tools
The aim of this project is to share a set of Matlab, Python, R scripts to facilitate neuroimaging data analyses and results display. 

I made these scripts based on easily available toolboxes and packages of the most popular scientific programming language.

The motivation of this project is that some excellent softwares for neuroimaging processing, analyses and display were developped in some special platforms, such as FSL and FreeSurfer in Unix/Linux. However, not all of the researchers want to deeply divie into these softwares and platforms -- that's too time- and energy-consuming. Some neuroimaging researchers just want to analyze and show the outputs of these softwares in an easier way.
